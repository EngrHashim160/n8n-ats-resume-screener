This n8n workflow automates the process of **retrieving candidate resumes from Outlook**, **extracting data**, and **evaluating them** against stored job descriptions using an **AI-powered ATS scoring system**.  

It:

2. Downloads and processes attached resumes (PDF or DOCX ‚Üí PDF).
3. Extracts text from resumes.
4. Matches the candidate's job title to stored job postings in Airtable.
5. Uses OpenAI to score the resume based on a strict **100-point rubric**.
6. Filters and stores shortlisted candidates in Google Drive and Airtable.
